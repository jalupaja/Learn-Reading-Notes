"Learn Reading Notes" is a simple, small App created to learn the names of music notes in Violin and Bass key.
The naming is german, because for some reason the english 'B' is called 'H' in german and the english 'Bes' is called 'B'.

the naming can be changed at the bottom of "app.py". The lines are marked with "# HERE".
